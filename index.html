<h3>Early Life</h3>

<p>
  Astley was born on 6 February 1966 in Newton-le-Willows in Lancashire,
   the fourth child of his family. His parents divorced when he was five
   and Astley was brought up by his father. Astley remained in very close
    contact with his mother, who lived a few streets away from his father.
   He After finding out that his father was the one who kicked his mother
    out of the house, Astley distanced himself from his father. When he was
  10 years old, Astley began singing in a local church choir, which began
   his love of music.

       During his schooldays, Astley formed and played the drums in a number of 
       local bands, where he met guitarist David Morris. After leaving school at 
       sixteen, Astley was employed during the day as a driver in his father's 
       market-gardening business and played drums on the Northern club circuit 
         at night in bands such as Give Way – specialising in covering Beatles and
          Shadows songs – and FBI, which won several local talent competitions.

 <h3>1987: Success</h3>
 <p>
  His first single was "When You Gonna", released as a collaboration with Lisa Carter.
   The song was released in May 1987, and with no promotion managed to chart at
    No. 17 in the Netherlands and No. 20 in Belgium.
    <br>
    <br>
    Astley's first solo offering was "Never Gonna Give You Up", recorded on New Year's
     Day 1987, and released eight months later, in August. Astley's distinctive rich,
      deep voice combined with dance-pop made the song an immediate success, spending
     five weeks at the top of the British charts and becoming the year's highest-selling
     single. The song was also a worldwide number-one hit, topping the charts in 24
       other countries, including the US, Australia, and West Germany. It was the first
       of 13 (worldwide) top 30 hit singles for him. "Never Gonna Give You Up" won 
      Best British Single at the 1988 BPI awards (now called the BRIT Awards), and he 
      performed it in front of a global audience of 100 million.
          <br>
          <br>
      Astley's next single was "Whenever You Need Somebody", which was released 
      in October. The single was a recycled Stock Aitken Waterman song, originally
     recorded by O'Chi Brown in 1985. It became a successful European hit, reaching
     No 1 in seven countries, including West Germany and Sweden. It also reached No
           3 in the UK. It was not released in North America.
           <br>
           <br>
       In November 1987, the album Whenever You Need Somebody, containing four 
       tracks written by Astley, reached number one in the UK and Australia and
       No 10 in the US. It was certified 4x Platinum in the UK and Canada, and 
       2x Platinum in the US. Whenever You Need Somebody sold 15.2 million copies 
       worldwide, making Astley the top-selling British act of the year.
       <br>
       <br>
       In December 1987, Astley released a cover version of the Nat King Cole classic
        "When I Fall in Love". This single is mainly remembered for a closely fought 
        contest for UK Christmas Number 1. Rivals EMI, hoping to see their act the Pet 
        Shop Boys reach No 1, rereleased Cole's version.[23][24] This led to a slowdown 
        of purchases of Astley's version, allowing the Pet Shop Boys to reach the coveted 
        top spot with their cover version of Always on My Mind. Despite selling over 200,
        000 copies and gaining a Silver certification from the BPI, Astley's
         "When I Fall in Love" peaked in the UK at No 2 for two weeks. The rerelease of 
         Cole's version reached No 4. The B side for Astley was a dance number, 
         "My Arms Keep Missing You", which was successful in mainland Europe but wasn't
          released on an album until the 2002 compilation Greatest Hits.

 <h3>1994–2000: Retirement</h3>
 <p>
  After 1993, Astley retired from the music industry at 27, deciding that family life 
  was more important. During his time out of the music business, he raised his daughter
  Emilie, born in 1992. For much of the 1990s and early 2000s, Astley remained out of 
  the spotlight. He later said this was due to his growing frustration with the business 
  side of things. During this period he co-wrote "Mission Statement", a track for former
  Marillion singer Fish's 1999 solo album Raingods with Zippos.

 <h3>1994–2000: Retirement<h3>
 <p>
  In 2007, Astley became the subject of a viral Internet meme known as rickrolling.
   The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink that leads to
    the music video. When victims click on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with
   the music video loads instead of what was expected, and in doing so they are said
     to have been "Rickrolled". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics
     in unexpected places. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several
      publicized events, particularly when YouTube used it on its 2008 April Fools' Day
     event.Rickrolling saw a massive resurgence online in the early 2020s. In online 
      classes on Zoom during the worldwide COVID-19 lockdown, students often rickrolled
       their classmates and teachers. A 4K remaster of the "Never Gonna Give You Up"
        music video went viral in early 2021.
        <br>
        <br>
        Initially, Astley, who had only recently returned to performing after a 10-year
        hiatus, was hesitant about using his newfound popularity from the meme to further
         his career, but accepted the fame when he Rickrolled the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving
         Day Parade with a surprise performance of the song. Since then, Astley has seen his
         performance career revitalised by the meme's popularity. In an interview, Astley
         stated that one of his favourite Rickroll videos is "BarackRoll", a rickroll featuring
       clips from rallies by Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign, edited to 
         make it look as though he is singing "Never Gonna Give You Up".
         <br>
         <br>
         Astley himself has been rickrolled a few times; in fact, the first time he was 
         rickrolled actually pre-dated the viral phenomenon. In an interview with Larry 
         King, Astley stated that the first time he fell for the prank was through an email
          his friend sent him during the early 2000s. On a Reddit post in June 2020, a user 
        claimed to have met Astley backstage when they were 12 years old, but the user posted
         a link to the song instead of a picture verifying the encounter. Astley later confirmed
         he had been tricked into clicking the link. The post became the most upvoted
          post of 2020 on Reddit.
